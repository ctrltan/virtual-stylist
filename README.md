# virtual-stylist-sample-

Created as part of my final year project, this virtual stylist extracts features from runway images and clusters them by similar style. The stylist then explores the clusters and finds similar clothing items to create outfits to recommend to the user. The user then provides feedback and the stylist's search is adjusted.

This project is still in development. Sample code from 2 files is provided.
